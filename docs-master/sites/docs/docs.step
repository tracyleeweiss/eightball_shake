# [Installfest](/installfest)

Instructions for installing Ruby and Rails on your computer. You are required to do this before going to a Rails workshop!

# [Curriculum](/curriculum)

The "classic" railsbridge curriculum (Suggestotron). Takes you step-by-step through making a Rails app, one command at a time, using helpers like `rails generate scaffold`.

# [Intermediate Rails](/intermediate-rails)

Curriculum for students who have taken Suggestotron more than once. 'Easy mode' is now OFF - this curriculum won't tell you what to type in!

# [Frontend](/frontend)

HTML + CSS for beginners. Make a website, no server required!

# [Ruby](/ruby)

A ruby-specific curriculum, expanded from the "Ruby for Beginners" slide deck. Still new, with room for your contributions.

# [Workshop](/workshop)

The Railsbridge junkyard! Slide decks for opening/closing presentations, teacher training.
